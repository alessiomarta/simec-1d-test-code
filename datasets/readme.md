- surface_1 : Python script to generate the dataset and to train the neural network for the first and fourth numerical experiments ("Learning compact equivalence classes" and "Learning preimages of compact equivalence classes").

- surface_2 : Python script to generate the dataset and to train the neural network for the second numerical experiment ("Learning non compact equivalence classes").

- thermodynamics : The script "thermodynamics.py" generates the dataset and trains the neural network for the third and fifth numerical experiments ("A thermodynamics problem" and "Thermodynamics: learning a family of isothermal curves"). "true_isothermal.py" plots the true isothermal curve corresponding to the temperature chosen in the paper.

- classification : Dataset and neural network for the sixth numerical experiment ("A classification problem").
