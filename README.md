# simec-1d-test-code
 Code for the numerical experiments of the paper "A singular Riemannian geometry approach to Deep Neural Networks II. Reconstruction of 1-D equivalence classes."
 
A brief description of the code and the documentation can be found at https://alessiomarta.github.io/simec-1d-test-code/html/index.html.

A python implementation (using PyTorch) of the algorithms can be found at https://github.com/alessiomarta/extension_singular_riemannian_framework_code.
